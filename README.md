# Tic-tac-toe from official react tutorial.

In this project, i intend to make tic-tac-toe better by making it have a good UI and by adding the following suggestions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

&nbsp;&nbsp;6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
